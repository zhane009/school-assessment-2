Question: 
You have been tasked with building an app (designed for children) which allows them to calculate the area and perimeter of a variety of different shapes including: squares, rectangles, circles, triangles, parallelograms and hexagons. The program is required to do the following:

•	Allow children to select a shape.
•	Allow children to enter the dimensions of the shape.
•	Calculate the area of the shape.
•	Calculate the perimeter of the shape.
•	Allow children to repeat process.


In addition, the following functionality has been identified as desirable and should be implemented where possible:

•	Display using ASCII characters 2D and 3D shapes.
•	Allow children to build a compound shape (2 shapes made from the ones above) and calculate the area and perimeter of the compound shape.
•	Allow children to build three dimensional shapes: cube, sphere, cylinder and pyramid and calculate the area and perimeter of said shapes.
